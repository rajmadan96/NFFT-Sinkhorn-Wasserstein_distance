# NFFT-Sinkhorn-Wasserstein_distance-
This contribution features an accelerated computation of the Wasserstein transportation distance and the Sinkhorn divergence by employing nonequispaced fast Fourier transforms (NFFT). The method overcomes numerical stability issues of the straightforward convolution of the standard, fast Fourier transform (FFT). Also, the algorithm is faster than the traditional Sinkhorn algorithm.  Further, the proposed method avoids expensive allocations of the characterizing matrices. With this numerical acceleration, the transportation distance is accessible to probability measures out of reach so far. Numerical experiments using synthetic data and real data affirm the computational advantage and supremacy.
